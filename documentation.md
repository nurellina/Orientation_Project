***November***

  

-   Watched many of “Introduction to Touchdesigner” videos on youtube, sometimes it becomes embarrassing that I spend lots of time on trying to find good information, rather than actually learning. In the end the best and up-to date introduction video was the one of the developers of Touchdesigner Ben Voigt (4 hours). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmM1lCWtn6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmM1lCWtn6o)
    

  

-   Finished the book “An Introduction to Touchdesigner” by Nvoid ([https://nvoid.github.io/](https://nvoid.github.io/)) Good adds-on to Ben Voigt’s video. Insight from the book - for the type of visuals I want I need to user GLSL shader, it’s possible to integrate GLSL shaders from Shadertoy, but it’s still a bit tricky. Made my first simulation.

-   Started to read “The Book of Shaders” ([https://thebookofshaders.com/](https://thebookofshaders.com/)) to learn more about GLSL Shaders to code my own shader, but gave up at the middle. Insight from the book - shaders are really fun and cool, but for the scope of this project it’s hard to learn them from scratch. The books is really good though, highly recommended!

  

***December***

  

-   Decided to get rid of the idea of using external shaders and work with what I’ve got in Touchdesigner. Started learning from the tutorials by Matthew Ragan, in some way Daniel Shiffman of Touchdesigner
    

  

-   Watched tutorials from Yale Workshop of Matthew Ragan, which he recommends for absolute beginners. Spend the whole day building the web movie player, hoping to learn more about the logic of the program, gave up almost in the end realizing that I’m loosing time and it’s not that much help for my own project [https://matthewragan.com/touchdesigner-workshop-yale-2017/](https://matthewragan.com/touchdesigner-workshop-yale-2017/)

-   Started his other workshop THP 494 & 598 | Generative Media for Live Performance [https://matthewragan.com/teaching-resources/touchdesigner/thp-494-598-generative-media-for-live-performance/](https://matthewragan.com/teaching-resources/touchdesigner/thp-494-598-generative-media-for-live-performance/), which turned out to be better. Learned about Instancing, Noise CHOP, Feedback, Realtime Rendering networks, The Composite TOP. In the end made my first scene, using mostly noise CHOPs. Quite satisfied with it, taking into account that my reference images from Rafik Anadol were similar.

***January***

  

-   Started working on interaction. It turned out to be not so easy as I thought. Either I’m so stupid, or it’s actually not so well made in Touchdesiger as in Processing. All the information I could find was about mapping the object to the Mouse (using Mouse In Chop, then connecting it to the Select CHOP to select tx and ty chanells for mouse positions) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfA0IxwII84, but it’s not what I need, what I’m looking for is to be able mouse-click on the different areas of the container to make text appear in that areas. In the end of the research was able to start my first simulation using Keyboard In CHOP with pressing key 1 on keyboard. At least some sort of the interaction.

-   After Pitch and Peer review and talking to Valeria I realized that I can go to Touchdesighner Meetup in Berlin to get help from the community. I’ve been already once when I didn’t have any project and completely forgot about this opportunity. I’m gonna go there on January 30th at 19:30 and ask for help! :) [https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/TouchDesigner-Meetup-Berlin/events/](https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/TouchDesigner-Meetup-Berlin/events/)
